# Artifial Intelligence Course, Tampere University.
The course is based on Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence year model 2020 (https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/). The projects that were in this impelementation are listed below.

## Projects

### Tic Tac Toe
The project is to implementan AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally with using Minimax.

### Degrees of Separation 
Program that determines how many “degrees of separation” apart two actors are.

### Nim
AI that teaches itself to play Nim through reinforcement learning.

### Parser 
AI that parse sentences and extract noun phrases.

## Course brochure
After completing the course the student will have an overview of different areas and techniques of artificial intelligence. In particular, the student is able to apply to problems arising in application fields the basic methods of solving problems by searching, informed search and exploration, and probabilistic reasoning. Hands-on experience on artificial intelligence tools and techniques will be gathered in the weekly exercise sessions which include programming..
